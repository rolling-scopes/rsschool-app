## The allocation of students into teams

The process of allocation is totally automated. It is done via <span style="color:green_apple">[https://rss-teams.web.app](https://rss-teams.web.app/login)</span>

### Step #1 Registration

The app will offer you to fill in the registration form after you have been authorized in the system:

NB:

The score is filled by your score in the main course in RS School. If you have not studied in the main course, set your score as 100 in order to go through the validation process.

### Step #2 Creating a team or joining the team

There are 2 available buttons in the Teams page: <span style="color:orange">`Join team`</span> or <span style="color:orange">`Create team`</span>.

#### Create a team

There are 3 steps to create a team:

1. click <span style="color:orange">`Create team`</span>;
2. show the link to the team's chat;
3. show the password (so that other team members could join the team later).

Only one team member (Team lead) creates the team and shares the password with other members.

#### Join the team

To join the existing team you need to follow these steps:

1. Click <span style="color:orange">`Join team`</span>
2. show the password that was given to you by the Team lead

If you have not found the team, you need to register in the app and we will find a team for you.

If the number of students in the team is less than required, other members will be assigned to this team automatically.

After being assigned to the team you will see the following: 

![team](https://github.com/yuliaHope/rs-images/blob/main/Screenshot%202021-02-22%20at%2012.39.26.png)

To leave the team just click <span style="color:orange">`Leave team`</span>. Or you need someone to expel you from the team:
