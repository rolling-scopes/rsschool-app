## Cross-check

Cross-check is a peer-review of tasks by students according to given criteria.

## Process

### Step #1 Sending task to cross-check

To send the task to cross-check, enter <span style="color:green_apple">[app.rs.school](https://app.rs.school/)</span> and follow the link <span style="color:orange">`Cross-Check: Submit`</span>. Depending on the task requirements, show either a link to the working and deployed website or a link to the original code/Github repository. It is possible to submit the link several times - the last one is saved. All who do not meet the deadline and do not provide their link on time get 0. Deadlines are shown in the schedule.

### Step #2 Generating peers

After the deadline of the assignment, peers for cross-checking are generated. Every student has to check 4 other students' works.

### Step #3 Checking other's work

All who send their works for cross-checking, check each other's works. To do so, enter <span style="color:green_apple">[app.rs.school](https://app.rs.school/)</span> and follow the link <span style="color:orange">`Cross-Check: Review`</span>. How to check:

1. Select the task (For example, Portfolio).
2. Select the student.
3. After selecting the student, the link to one's work will appear. If the link is not working, please contact the student and ask for the working link.
4. Check the work according to the assessment criteria of the task.
5. Enter the mark in the form.
6. Leave a comment, explaining the mark given.
7. Send the form.
8. Every student checks 4 other works performed by other students.

### Step #4 Receiving the score and the comment

Cross-check score is an average of all marks given by reviewers. If the number of students who checked the work is 4, the lowest mark is tossed away, and the average of the remaining three marks is calculated as an overall score of the work. If there are fewer than 4 students, who checked the work, all scores contribute to the final score of the work. If you **do not check all 4 works before the deadline, your work gets 0**.

## Quality of cross-checking

The goal of the cross-check is not only about checking others' works and giving marks to them, but also learning for oneself and giving useful feedback to students, whose works you check. While checking, try to stick to the following rules:

- if the work you are checking is of high-quality, let the author know about it;
- if you think the work you are checking deserves others' attention, add the work's link to the form of the best works. If your work seems to be performed at a very high level, you can add your work to the form too.
- if you see any drawbacks in the work you are checking, do not just list them, try to help the author avoid such mistakes next time by telling them how to correct those mistakes.
- if the reviewer has left you well-detailed feedback with tips on how to improve your work, you can say thanks via <span style="color:green_apple">[rs app](https://app.rs.school/gratitude)</span>. NB: show your gratitude, not for high marks, but for valuable comments and tips.
- Most useful comments can be shared in discord in the #crosscheck channel (the reviewer's contacts must be hidden)

## Marking approach

- if you think the assessment criteria are fully satisfied mark it as 100%
- If you think there are considerable deviations from what has been asked and it is definitely cannot be treated as a feature, mark it as 50%
- If the criteria are not fulfilled, mark it as 0
- If the criteria imply an interconnected score, mark it either 100% or 0
- If the deviations are not critical, mark them for the student's benefit
- **If the score you are giving is not the highest possible, be polite and**
  - leave a detailed comment on why the score is reduced
  - leave any contacts (Discord, Telegram, etc.) so that reviewer could change your mark
  - you may always set a new score before the deadline with a comment why you have changed it
- If you think the work is copied, you need to:
  - inform the moderator of the course (with a private message)
  - mark it as 0

Dear students, be kind in conversations. If any inadequate correspondence is noticed (aggression, obscenities, insults, sexism, discrimination, etc. regardless of whether the score is unbiased and fair), the administration will take strict measures up to expulsion from the course in RS School provided that the screenshots of the correspondence are available.

## Responsibility for commenting reduced scores

This is about comments such as:

1. "good job, here is 50 out of 100"
2. "....................................."
3. "just many spaces" etc.

Administrators can check the reasons for the score reduction during the appeal (administrators can see names of anonymous reviewers). Those cross-checkers, who leave the above-mentioned comments, get:

1. Warning in the #moderation channel - for the first time.
2. Expulsion from the course - for the second time.

## Communication rules in Discord cross-check channel:

If you think the score given to you by the reviewer is wrong, and you want to make sure if it is fair or not, you can do it in the #cross-check channel.

Your message must contain:

1. A link to your work.
2. Your self-assessment regarding controversial points.
3. Reviewer's mark and his/her feedback.

These might help other students in the chat to help you notice your mistakes in case they exist, or agree with your point of view.

Messages in the channel #cross-check must be directed towards the discussion of the work (especially the task's bullet points), but not towards the reviewer or reviewee.

## Appeal

- takes place if there are any activists, who want to drive the process.
- takes place if you changed your work after the deadline.
- takes place after all checks of your work and step #4 completion (see above).
- takes place if your expected score and obtained average score (step #4) differ by 10 or more percent.
- the score can be increased as well as reduced without any further discussion.
- in case the difference between the score after the appeal and the score obtained in step #4 is less than 10%, the final score will not be increased.

To appeal:

1. Wait for all the checks of your work and completion of step #4 (see above). Check if all criteria are met in order to appeal (see above).
2. Create a new issue <span style="color:green_apple">[github.com/rolling-scopes-school/support/issues](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/support/issues)</span>. Call it by the following template: Cross-Check 'task title' - 'Your Github name'.
3. Fill in the issue with the following template (if the issue has a title, but is not filled correctly, it will not be reviewed):

- A link to your deployed project.
- A link to the project repository on Github.
- A link to the task.
- A link to the assessment form (if there are any).
- A screenshot of cross-checking marks (reviewers' contacts must be hidden).
- A final score after self-assessment with comments.
- A cross-check score of your Score.

## Appeal process

- Process starts after the cross-check deadline.
- There is a guide-mark "help wanted" for a valid issue (Labels -> "help wanted").
- Free activist chooses the issue - <span style="color:green_apple">[https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/support/issues](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/support/issues)</span>.
- The activist sets a guide-mark "review started" (Labels -> "review started").
- The activist checks the work following the assessment criteria of the task. Leaves his/her comments and mark. All see it, everything is transparent.
- The activist sets a guide-mark "review completed" (Labels -> "review completed").
- The activist notes the trainer (who assigned the task) in the comments of the issue.
- The trainer submits the score to the RS APP.
- The new score replaces the current score.

## Common decencies

After the appeal process thank the activist for his/her work and time. It is desirable if you use RS App Gratitude (<span style="color:green_apple">[https://app.rs.school/gratitude](https://app.rs.school/gratitude)</span>)

## Why Cross-check?

### Advantages

- checking all students' works before the deadline
- 100% understanding of how many people completed the task
- 95% of students accurately check works.
  Responsible students leave valuable comments.
- an excellent way of checking layouts
- cross-check allows students to compare their work with other's works; it allows students to understand at what level they are in comparison with other students
- there is a possibility to see how different students approach the same problem
- task assessment teaches to read technical requirements of the tasks accurately
- students learn to assess tasks as many of them come back to become mentors in RS School
- there is a possibility to look at the task from the user's point of view, learn something new about the app (e.g., some behavior that you haven't noticed while making the app)
- students are more responsible for reading the task requirements as they know that other students will check their work too
- practical skills of testing the app, which students can use in their projects in the future.

### Disadvantages

- assessments are not always fair
- an absence of the opportunity to contact the reviewer and discuss disputable moments
- not all are responsible while checking. Some write several lines, while others several pages of feedback
- a lot of time spent on checking
- need exact assessment criteria
