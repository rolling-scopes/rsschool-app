## Action plan: "What to do if something does not work in RS APP?"

1. Firstly, check if anybody else has faced the same problem in <span style="color:green_apple">[https://github.com/rolling-scopes/rsschool-app/issues](https://github.com/rolling-scopes/rsschool-app/issues)</span>. If the problem has already been described there, you need to leave a comment that this problem still needs to be resolved. If there is no such problem described move to the 2nd point below.
2. Ask about the problem in Discord channels (all tasks have their channels). Wait for answers from students/activists. If the problem has not been solved, move to the 3rd point below.
3. Ask about the problem in the Discord channel **#questions-to-rsapp**. Wait for comments from activists/admins. If the problem has not been solved, move to the 4th point below.
4. Create a new issue with the description of the problem in the repository <span style="color:green_apple">[https://github.com/rolling-scopes/rsschool-app/issues](https://github.com/rolling-scopes/rsschool-app/issues)</span>.

## Typical problems and their solutions

1. "No access" problem

   ![No Access Error](https://docs.rs.school/images/no-access.png)

   **Solution**: register to the course you need via <span style="color:green_apple">[link](https://app.rs.school/registry/student)</span>.
   
2. I do not know how to see my mistakes in the task after **Auto-test**.

   **Solution**: enter <span style="color:green_apple">[app.rs.school](https://app.rs.school/)</span> and follow the **Auto-test** section and choose the task you need in the drop-down list. Details of the check are shown in the **Details** column of the **Verification Results table**:

3. I submitted the task and got my mark, but the score has not changed yet.

   **Solution**: wait. For the changes to be updated some time is needed - usually, it takes 5 minutes.
