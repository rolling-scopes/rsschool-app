#### 🧑‍⚖️ Pull Request Naming Convention

```
 - Title should be a short informative summary of the pull request.
 - Do not put issue id in title
 - Do not put WIP in title. Use [Draft PR](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/) functionality
 - Consider to add `area:*` label(s)
```
 - [ ] I read and followed naming convention rules
